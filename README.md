# CS 546 - Group 19 - Final Project | Digital Closet
A website that allows you to take images of your clothes and upload them online. Users can then create digital outfits from the clothes they upload.

Built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Express, Node.js, and MongoDB.

## How to Setup
Since our database is running on Mongo Altas, **there is no need to seed the database**. But we have provided a seed file as a fallback.

### Using the Live Release
1. Visit the following link to use our website live on our Heroku server: https://lit-fortress-77121.herokuapp.com/

### Running it Locally
1. In the project folder terminal, run `npm start` to install node dependencies and start the website in the same command.
2. (Optional) run `npm run seed` to drop the current database and reseed it. However, **this will delete admin accounts**. 

### View Ready Made Accounts
There are three accounts you may use to test from. You can additionally make your own account. Here are the pre-made account logins: 
- lonelyloser | password123 
- froggyboi078 | password456
- pleaseGiveMeAnA | password789

Note: You can test the admin account feature with *lonelyloser*
